# collaboratory-pgs-data-standards

Experimental project under development.

## Overview

This is the repository for the IPSN Pathogen-Genomics-Surveillance Data-Standards Catalogue. 

The catalogue proper is [catalogue.json](./catalogue.json).

The catalogue fields names, types and permitted values are defined in [catalogue_model.json](./catalogue_model.json). 

The catalogue is displayed here: https://who-collaboratory.github.io/collaboratory-pgs-data-standards-page/

## How to

Here are the recommended steps to edit the catalogue:
1. Edit the catalogue by hand in the dev branch. There are no quality checks, so make sure to stick to the [catalogue_model.json](./catalogue_model.json). Note that there is a comment field to add free text.
2. Once it is validated, merge it into the stable branch.
